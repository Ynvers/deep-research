# DeepResearch: Multi-Agent Knowledge Discovery System
---

## ðŸš€ Project Objective
DeepResearch is a project aimed at developing a knowledge discovery system based on a multi-agent approach. The goal is to create intelligent agents that explore and analyze information across various domains to generate new ideas, insights, and solutions. Each agent operates autonomously but also collaborates to improve the efficiency of the research.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- **Cross-disciplinary Research**: Allow multiple agents to collaborate in exploring different domains and extracting relevant knowledge.
- **Search Optimization**: Agents continuously adjust their strategies to improve the accuracy and relevance of the results.
- **Self-Improvement**: Implement a feedback mechanism so agents learn from their searches and improve over time.

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
**Agent Prototypes**: Development of autonomous agents capable of conducting research and analyzing data across various domains.

Collaboration Mechanism: Integration of a system where agents share discoveries and collectively optimize their strategies.

Planning and Feedback: Implementing feedback loops to improve results with each iteration.
